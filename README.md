# Deprecation warning

As I'm not aware of another use of this libary other than my poraclePvpHelper plugin, the library will be deprecated along with the plugin
as soon as [PoracleJS PR #474](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS/pull/474) is merged.

# PogoPvpData
Library parsing Pokemon Go data to deliver PvP relevant calculations as a pyton object
